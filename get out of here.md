Yo sup guys so i just wanna share a way to make the desmos but in animation

first you need a pc, ye a pc

im too bored to make this organized so just follow my steps, good? good...


first i need you to install  install WSL so heres the link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

just follow everything there

after that go here: https://github.com/kevinjycui/DesmosBezierRenderer?tab=readme-ov-file

you can find the codes there to run after you open ubuntu and after re starting your pc

but ofc this is useless if you can justr use that link right? ofc that doesnt work anymore so i fixed it. UR welcome

first of all you need the video that you will turn into animation so you would need a download code line right? ye

so first of all open your terminal, just search on windows search bad "terminal" and use this code winget install yt-dlp

after thats installed, find the youtube video that you want to animate and copy the link, open the terminal again and dont forget to click open as an administrator

after you get your link follow this yt-dlp (link) and press enter and remember that to paste link you right click 

after that use the code FFMpeg to turn the video into frames.

after that go to your file manager and open the ubuntu/linux file folder and at the search bar at the top search for frames and that will be the folder where you will be putting the new frames but ofc delete the old ones first

and you might be wondering "why not just use youtube-dl?" well for some reason it got taked down and i made this fix to make it still work. So just be grateful

after this just follow the instructions on: https://github.com/kevinjycui/DesmosBezierRenderer?tab=readme-ov-file

and btw dont use powershell, use terminal if you dont want to waste 2h of your life

and the program for this is called winget if ur curious, but you can use chocolatey or scoop

also if you use anotehr way to turn teh video into frames you will be limited to frames per second and video length and this is the most feasible way to bypass it.

if you need help just text me. 

some screenies as a guide:

get out of here







-----------------

this is another way to do it and the way that i made personally 
rather than using wls you can use ubuntu, its a little harder but errors are easier to fix
so first search for ubuntu on google and download the iso
download a virtual machine, i personally use oracle
just watch yt videos on how to open ubuntu using oracle

after loading oracle, you can now use ubuntu ur welcome
after that go to terminal and read this:https://github.com/kevinjycui/DesmosBezierRenderer

but the things is this is wont work anymore since its unupdated so i made a patch

first you need to install another version of python and i used 3.10 
just keep in mind that through out this process there will be a bunch and bunch of errors and it took me 10 hours to fix these and i cant list all of them here so if you need help please do message me in facebook or email me on zamorabernard451@gmail.com

you might ecounter some errors regarding pynev and distutils and generally requires to download pip or the downgrade of python version

i generally made this to guide you with the errors but its hard to specify each and every one so please just ask me if you need help.

heres what it would look like if it is successful and ur ready to go, also please do keep in mind that installing a new version of python takes time


--------
get started
well lets start on how to download the coding program
first go to:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
and open your powershell in windows search bar and click run administrator
and when you opened it 
type this wsl --install on powershell
after that wait for it to install and restart your pc
